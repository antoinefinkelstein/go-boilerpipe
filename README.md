Java library written by Christian Kohlsch√ºtter_

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jlubawy/go-boilerpipe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jlubawy/go-boilerpipe) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/jlubawy/go-boilerpipe?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/jlubawy/go-boilerpipe)

Boilerpipe removes boilerplate and extracts text content from HTML documents.

Currently it only supports article extraction which includes the title,
the date, and the content.

Best attempts will be made to follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html#semantic-versioning-200) rules,
but no API guarantees will be made until version 1.0.0.

However, existing tags will not change guaranteeing that [vendoring](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html#semantic-versioning-200) will not break.
